\title{Calculate constructs frequently used in social sciences research while leveraging
[tidycensus::get_acs()] to acquire raw estimates from the Census Bureau API.}
\usage{
compile_acs_data(
  variables = NULL,
  years = c(2022),
  geography = "county",
  states = NULL,
  counties = NULL,
  retain_moes = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variables}{A named vector of ACS variables such as that returned from
[urbnindicators::list_acs_variables()].}

\item{years}{A character vector (or coercible to the same) comprising one or more
four-digit years for which to pull five-year American Community Survey estimates.}

\item{geography}{A geography type that is accepted by [tidycensus::get_acs()], e.g.,
"tract", "county", "state", among others.}

\item{states}{A vector of one or more state names, abbreviations, or codes as
accepted by [tidycensus::get_acs()].}

\item{counties}{A vector of one or more county names, abbreviations, or codes as
accepted by [tidycensus::get_acs()]. NOTE: this parameter is not currently supported
and must be set to NULL (as it is by default).}

\item{retain_moes}{Boolean. Include margins of error (MOE) in the returned dataframe,
or omit them?}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the requested `variables`, their MOEs (optionally),
   a series of derived variables, such as percentages, and the year of the data.
   Returned data are formatted wide.
