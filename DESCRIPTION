Description: There are many packages available that facilitate queries to the Census
  Bureau API, but subsequent steps in the analysis workflow still require significant
  work (much of which must be repeated from analysis to analysis), such as identifying
  and selecting relevant variables, determining how to accurately calculate derived 
  measures (e.g., percentages), and naming variables semantically. urbnindicators
  abstracts much of this process away and provides users a simple interface to obtain
  commonly-used social sciences measures from the ACS.
