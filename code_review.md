Overall Thoughts:

Thanks for the chance to review this package! In my review, I reviewed the code for compliance with Census best practices, checked that the formulas were correctly applied, ran the code with the test data to confirm it worked properly, and reviewed comments for clarity. 

I wasn't able to run `calculate_cvs(df)`, where df is the test file `test_data_2025-05-13.rds` I read in, and got the following error at line 240:
Error in `dplyr::rename_with()`:

I made comments throughout starting with "AS:", some are suggestions but there are a couple of places where I believe the implementation is not aligned with best practices:

- Handling of controlled estimates by creating no_moe_flag on line 190 doesn't account for variation across geographic levels and observations of whether MOEs are controlled.
- I believe you are converting the calculated SE for sum estimates to SE again on line 327, which would yield incorrect results
- I wasn't quite following the logic for the approach to calculating the CV/SE for estimates with no MOE denominators on line 343 - does this come from a census recommendation? I suggested an alternative but let me know if I just didn't see the relevant census recommendation.

A few other census best practices for you to think about:
- You mentioned trying to use the VRE tables and not finding them useful, but if you're open to re-exploring those, it could be an approach to calculating more accurate SEs for derived sum variables. 
- I noted that the compile_acs_data.R function takes a vector of years as a parameter. The [instructions for statistical testing](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/statistical_testing/2023_Instructions_for_Stat_Testing_ACS.pdf) suggest that ACS data from 2005 or earlier should use 1.65 instead of 1.645 when converting MOE to SE. I imagine that using such early ACS years could cause a host of other problems, so I might add a validation to `compile_acs_data` to confirm the years are greater than 2005.
- In addition to the controlled estimates, I saw in the same instructions for statistical testing that MOEs that have two or three stars or asterisks (** or ***) indicate that a "statistical test is not appropriate." I'm not sure how often that occurs or how tidycensus differentiates those cases from controlled estimates, but it could be worth flagging for users to caution them against calculating significance using those variables. 
- The ACS handbooks and instructions for statistical testing both note that the number of basic estimates involved in the sum or difference increases, the results of this formula become increasingly different from the standard error derived directly from the ACS microdata, and recommend working with the fewest number of basic estimates as possible.Perhaps you could consider a warning when the number of estimates in the numerator or denominator exceeds some threshold number.
- Similarly, the guidance states that if there are estimates involved in the sum that are controlled in the weighting then the approximate standard error can be tremendously different. I see there are tests for controlled estimates in the denominator, but I didn't see anything for testing if they're used in sum derived variables (if that could occur). That could be another place for a warning!
